Hello there! I am a second-year Master's student at [School of Computer and Communication Engineering](http://scce.ustb.edu.cn/), [University of Science and Technology Beijing](http://www.ustb.edu.cn/). My research interest includes multimodal large language models, computer vision, layout analysis, and machine learning. 

With a vibrant and optimistic personality, I thrive on embracing challenges and pushing the boundaries of what's possible.

Beyond the academic realm, my passions include photography and travel, which not only enrich my life but also inspire my work in technology. I believe that every photo captured and every place visited can offer unique perspectives and insights, much like the data we analyze in the field of AI.

I'm keen to connect with individuals passionate about technology and its transformative power. Open to sharing ideas, exploring projects, and collaborating on innovation. Let's work together to unlock future possibilities.

May AI be with us as we embark on this exciting journey of innovation and discovery!
